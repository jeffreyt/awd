# TinyMonitor

TinyMonitor is a barebones chrome extension designed to track and notify you of Amazon Warehouse Deals listings.
You can set your own price range, if you prefer to wait until an item has gone under a certain price.

TinyMonitor will list the lowest price and the condition listed for that price.

A "how to use" will be included eventually. Sorry for the mess!
